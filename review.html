I have nothing to say but great things about this property. The house was spacious, clean and had everything we needed including beach accessories. The fenced in yard with fire pit was perfect for enjoying the outdoors and keeping my dog within the property. Thank you, Alicia, for your hospitality and for allowing pets! Not many properties allow pets...particularly not as nice as yours. The front porch and back deck were great for having morning coffees and just relaxing. The house is close enough to the beach and center, yet far enough from the hustle and bustle. We will definitely be back in the upcoming years.

Thanks again,

The Meneses Family

We were looking for a place with enough space for teenagers to spread out, to cook and grill for ourselves, close to the beach and other adventures. This was just the place for us! We had perfect weather for as many beach days as we wanted, plus it was a central location to explore many of the other activities Maine has to offer. The house was in great condition, the local hosts were very helpful, and we completely recommend this property.

A lovely home and well maintained. The neighbors were kind of bothering us during our stay, may want to consider talking to them about it. That aside, excellent vacation!
